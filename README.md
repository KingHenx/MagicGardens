# MagicGardens
This is my still ongoing Mobile game project for target audience of 3 - 10 year old girls about building your dream garden and getting different Unicorns species to visit there. There is still lot to be done but this is the base of the game.

now consists of features:
- Add 3 different garden items and decorate your garden with them.
- Pattern recognition system that calculates a rating for your garden based on decoration symmetry.
- Based on your gardens rating more Unicorns spawn to your Garden.
- Unicorns give Happiness points every 5 seconds and you can use happiness points to buy more decorative items to your garden.
- Game saves your happiness, unicorn amount and garden item positions.
